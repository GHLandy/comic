- Table of DOS
- "There was a time that we didn't have Windows, Linux or OSX. We just had DOS."


- in old times we use to have this PC runing DOS. Sometimes with no hard disk.
- But we had these beautiful 5-1/4 floppy diskk with the fantastic 360 Kb capacity.


- I got this new game "Test Drive", can you believe is uses 2 disk?
- 2 entire disk? OMG, could you imagine the resolution?
- Let's put this beauty to run.


- Dude,  that's perfect! It seems like a real car!
- That's 720 Kb of pure reality! Thank you Accloade!
