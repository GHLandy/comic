![The Real Reason to Not Use SIGKILL](http://turnoff.us/image/en/dont-sigkill.png)

- This is Bob. Bob is A Linux Process.
- Hi!
- Like any process, Bob has his threads,With whom he shares context, memories and love.
- And Like all processes, Inevltably sometime he will be killed.
- When we gracefully kill a process with a soft SIGTERM...
- ...We give him the chance to talk with his kids about it . So the kids finish their tasks...
- ... And say goodbye to each other.
- That's a process life!
- On the other hand, When we brutally kill a process with a SIGKILL,we prevent them from finishing their job and say goodbye...
- ...and this is so SAD!
- DAD!!!
- So please , DON't use SIGKILL. Give the kids the chance to leave the kernel in peace. 
- Be Nice.
- Dad ,where are we going?
- Dad, where are you?
