- Hi  Coy , My luck you are not down!
- Can you process this request for me ?
- We are never down Mr...Dan. But tell me , What's your timeout ,because...
- ...Currently all my http threads are really busy!
- Hey Coy, that guy does not seem busy.
- Be cool with the guy Dan. He is Blocked by a DB operation, he can't do nothing.
- Guys! Stop fighting for the lock, please. Sorry Dan, Sometimes it happens.
- Dan, You are lucky now . #15 is dealing with a stack overflow , I will send him your request befor he returns to the pool.
- I need more stack size, Coy!
- It's not your fault, It's bad code. Process this for Dan, Please.
- Dan , here is your page and your free cookie. Next time bring us the cookie ID we will work faster.
- Thanx coy
- I love this company.
