- Last Weekend I decided to take my son to Disney World, But there was something different there...
- Dad, The park's changed!
- I think it's much cooler now, Don't You?
- Look son, They are all java parks!This will be real fun!
- Dad,even the billboards are written in geek.
- So we entered the dark and the joy started...
- ...and we had fun at all those geek attractions...
- Cool, Let's check the Servlets on tomcat Island!
- Sweet! I want to see the mysterious valve!!
- Exception thrown! Evacuate the park!Exception thrown! Evacuate the park!
- Dad, what are exceptions?
- Nevermind, Just run! I'll expl...
- Run Son, Run!!
- Dad!
- Got you!
- Arrgh! Another Java Nightmare!
